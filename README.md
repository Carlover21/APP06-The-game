# Game Description
This app will a create a simple 2D game similar to PacMan where the player moves a character around the screen eating, picking up or shooting some item, whilst other actors (objects that also move around) hinder or get in the way of the player's character completing their mission.    

The app can be developed using C# and [MonoGame](https://www.monogame.net/) for any suitable platform such as Mobile Phone, Tablet, Games Console or Desktop using IOS, Android, Windows, Linux, PS4, XBox.  This video [The Best Games Made with MonoGame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S8pixXWqD0&ab_channel=AskGamedev) is a good introduction to the history of MonoGame.

If you are working on a Mac with IOS please watch the first 7 minutes of [Getting Started with MonoGame using Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hxo9A0-qcVo&ab_channel=TheDarksideofMonoGame)

[Please watch the following YouTube Video Series over the Easter Break](https://github.com/BNU-CO453/ConsoleApps15/wiki/Introduction-to-MonoGame)     

Take a copy if this wiki page and come back from Easter with a selected game outline including a general description of the game and a list of specific features that match the original user requirements.   

You can start the game from scratch with a new MonogGame project (see the videos for week 9) or take a copy of this
